## How Do I Web Develop?

There are some fantastic resources online which can answer pretty much all of your questions. One of the
first things to practice is _using Google effectively_. It's important that we consider **Time** as a finite
resource and spending a lot of time looking and not finding good quality information can be a problem.

You can start by just asking Google, [how do i google 
effectively](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=how+to+google+effectively&*)?

For web-development-specific questions, it's good to include notable websites in the query, here are a few popular ones:

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - ie, `mdn on click handler`
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - ie, `css tricks flexbox`
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - ie, `stackoverflow hover state hidden`

These are good ways to make sure you're getting the best information, quickly. Also, for sites like Stack Overflow, you can
see how certain answers are rated by other users, and read their comments to figure out what's the best solution to the problem
you're trying to solve.

### Online tools, general web-dev learning apps

### JavaScript

With JavaScript, or any other programming language, it's often better to read a book, rather than try to assemble knowledge from
various blogs and tweets. Stick close to primary sources and dig deep. The better you understand the language, the more better your life will be,
_I guarantee it_ :dizzy:.

- [JavaScript For Cats](http://jsforcats.com/) - Great, brief beginner book
- [Speaking JavaScript](http://speakingjs.com/) - Very thorough book from a great author
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) - A good mid++ level book, easier to read but the material can be dense
